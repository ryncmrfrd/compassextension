# ðŸ“Œ Achive Notice
This repo has been archived as a record of the things I made when I was learning to code throughout highschool. 
Read on for a quick guide and retrospective, otherwise you can check out my current projects on my website.

# ðŸ§­ CompassExtension
This was my first foray into building Google Chrome Extensions, aimed at injecting a stylesheet into the homepage of [Compass](https://www.compass.education/), a school management platform which was in use at my highschool at the time.

So why? Well, in 2020 Compass was using an absolutely archaic UI design, and I, as a 16 year old amateur "coder", knew the solution! I went about writing my own CSS file to override the Web 1.0 components on the homepage, which I would access everyday to see my schedule and assignments coming up.

Unlike my previous works, I actually wrote all of the main CSS myself, with the help of a few friends and the internet. Additionally, this was the first time I came accross [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/), which I would use extensively in the coming years.

Later, in 2021, I would also experiment with Sass for the first time, to limited success. I attempted to convert the whole nearly 300-line codebase (which seemed pretty impressive at the time) to a series of modular `.scss` files, a skill which I learned during my work exprience at [Emprevo](https://www.emprevo.com/) in 2019 due to their use of Angular in the development stack. This was a pretty tame introduction into the *joys* of refactoring code.

All of this being said, I learned a lot from this project despite it being of little practical value, with the skills following me on to this day ðŸ˜†. Particularly, building more Chrome Extensions played a large part in me learning more practical and nuanced JS skills, which I would then transition into a variety of other languages.
